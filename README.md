# Idea

The idea was to create a profile browser similar to this: https://codesandbox.io/s/mytinder-forked-xgkui?file=/src/components/CardBoard.js, which is built using the react-swipe-card dependency, but my goal was to make it from scratch. However due to that I had to get my head around React again, I couldnÂ´t achieve to implement the full feature, e.g the transition on the card when you swipe.

# Getting Started with Profile Browser

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the required dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
